# EPA-RFI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI)

Product

The Applied Information Sciences team created a product named Daily Ozone (DO).  DO allows a US Citizen to see the air quality in their current location or other locations by ZipCode as well as the outdoor activities that would be safe to perform given the air quality index.

Approach

Our goal was to tackle an achievable prototype (MVP) that demonstrated our HCD, Front end, back end, DevOps, Agile processes skillsets.  We did everything in the open from our planning, project management in the trello board to open github repo and docker hub repos as well.

Our team managed the product from start to finish on a public [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/mnICIANW/epa-rfi-prototype-product).   The idea was utilize the Air Quality APIs/Data that EPA publishes to create a Minimum Viable Product, that is a product that we could create given the part time nature of the team and the holidays.

We had an initial team of 10 to start this but because of workload and holidays there was really just a core team that worked on the product.
