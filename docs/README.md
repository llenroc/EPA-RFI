This is the Docs section where all of the documentation related to the Daily Ozone prototype creation are stored.  Below is a list of each of those documents and a brief description:

1. Personas - 2 personas were created [Persona A](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-UserPersonas-A.jpg) and [Persona B](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-UserPersonas-B.jpg), these are profiles of a typical user falling into one of our target audiences.
2. Competitive Analysis - In the absence of research with direct users, our team peformed a [competitive analysis](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-Competitive%20Analysis.pdf) to understand how applications with a similar purpose behave.
3. Heuristic Evaluations - Post competetive analysis, our team performed Heauristic Evaluations of a [competitor application](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-HeuristicEvaluation_AirNow.pdf) and our [own application](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-HeuristicEvaluation_DO.pdf).  This evaluation allowed us to compare usability across the two applications to better understand how our application would score against the competitor in usability.
4. Activity Cards Analysis - This was an [analysis of our applications activity card](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-ActivityCardsAnalysis.pdf) wording and an attempt to provide more human centric language across the application.
5. User Observance Tests - Post sprint 1 completion and review, we performed [Think Aloud Protocols testing](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/Usability%20Test%20Findings.pdf), we describe the test and the findings in this document.
