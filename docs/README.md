This is the Docs section where all of the documentation related to the Daily Ozone prototype creation are stored.  Below is a list of each of those documents and a brief description:

1. Personas - 2 personas were created [Persona A](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-UserPersonas-A.jpg) and [Persona B](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-UserPersonas-B.jpg), these are profiles of a typical user falling into one of our target audiences.
2. Competitive Analysis - In the absence of research with direct users, our team peformed a [competitive analysis](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-Competitive%20Analysis.pdf) to understand how applications with a similar purpose behave.
3. Heuristic Evaluations - Post competetive analysis, our team performed Heauristic Evaluations of a [competitor application](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-HeuristicEvaluation_AirNow.pdf) and our [own application](https://github.com/AppliedIS/EPA-RFI/blob/master/docs/DailyOzone-HeuristicEvaluation_DO.pdf).  This evaluation allowed us to compare usability across the two applications to better understand how our application would score against the competitor in usability.
4. Activity Cards Analysis
5. User Observance Tests
